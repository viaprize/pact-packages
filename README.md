## What's inside?

This repo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `client`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `client` 
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).


### Getting Started with docker
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1. Build Docker Image
In the project directory, run the following command to build the Docker image for the client service:

`docker-compose build client`

2. Declare the Network
Declare the required network for inter-container communication. This step is necessary to ensure the containers can communicate using their container names as hostnames.

`docker network create --driver=bridge app_network`

3. Run the Services
Start the client service using the following command. This will launch the containerized application and connect it to the specified network.

`docker-compose up -d client`

The -d flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing you to continue using the terminal.



### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
